                    <p>I'm sitting at the swing. Looking out to miles upon miles of greenery. You can even see the mountains at the skyline.</p>
<p>The sun is not too far from setting. We're leaving tomorrow. Trip's gonna be about 8 to 9 hours, give or take. Depending on where you live, or the life you've lead, that probably sounds like a lot. To me, it's not harrowing, especially since I know I'll have cellular data for most of the way. Can't say I've had that during my stay here, heh. Haven't been able to carry on with my Pikmin Bloom grind. Not that it matters though, I had already been slacking on it for a while. What does worry me, however, is that I already know I'm not going to be super comfortable the entire way through. I'm not tall enough for the headrest, so I have to remove it and put my hoodie there instead. And if I get close to falling asleep, my head starts falling sideways, which gets really uncomfortable and wakes me up. When I got here from the trip, I was wasted. So I guess that's something I'm not quite looking forward to.</p>
<p>But that's a little too far ahead, isn't it?</p>
Right now, as I'm typing this, I'm still on the swing. It rocks back and forth in a pretty rythmic fashion- whether it's my own weight or the light breeze swinging me, I leave up to you. If you ask me how I feel, looking around, breathing in the air, I'd say that it's alright. Nice, even.</p>
		    <p>Although, I wish I was alone.</p>
                    <p>I walk up to the swimming pool. I'm surprised to see my mother by herself. I ask her about father, and she says he's gonna come with her to take the last dip in the pool. I tell her that I feel like I've already done it, and go back inside.</p>
		    <p>I see that my brother's leaving, he tells me he was heading to the swings with me. I tell him I'm on my way back inside, but that I could keep him company if he wanted. He says that I can do whatever I want. I can tell he's genuine. I appreciate it.</p>
	   	    <p>I head to the bathroom- I wanna shower early so I can get the smell of bleach off of me as soon as possible. I look at myself in the mirror. I'm wearing two swimsuits: a one piece lady's swimsuit, with a blue and green leaf pattern, and one pair of my brother's old swimming shorts, colored cyan. It's a good match, in all honesty.</p>
		    <p>I take off the swimming shorts, take off the one piece suit, and don't walk into the shower. I put on the swimming shorts again and stand in the bidet to take a good look at myself. And you might be surprised to hear me saying this, but it's actually a good fit. Even with my breasts and my hideous waist, I actually feel alright. I feel like myself.</p>
		    <p>And I can't leave this bathroom.</p>
		    <p>I can't go to the swimming pool.</p>
		    <p>If I did, I would have to put the one piece swimsuit on.</p>
		    <p>So I make the most of this moment. I make the most of the reflection I see, even if it's not quite me. At least, until an actually masculine voice breaks the moment.</p>
		    <p>"Hey, are you done showering yet?"</p>
		    <p>"No, I haven't gotten started"</p>
		    <p>"Well, I'm going to shower after you, so you better get started!"</p>
		    <p>I take the swimming shorts off, and step into the shower.</p>
