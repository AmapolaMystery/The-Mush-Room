                    <summary>About the author</summary>
                    <p>Howdy! My online name is Amapola Mystery. I am an argentine trans man, and I use he/him pronouns, alongside other masculine terminology.</p>
                    <p>I am also a creative, and enjoy various artistic activities, such as drawing, image & video editing, writing, sculpting, and animating. Don't let this list intimidate you, though: I mostly just draw and edit. I have also found some enjoyment in understading and making use of html- hence the existence of this website. I am also a casual gamer, with a small repertoire of games I've played extensively throughout the years. (More on that a few paragraphs below.)</p>
                    <p>I've been told I'm a pretty sociable person, but the truth is that enough trial and error have helped me figure out how to come off as charming and likeable. If you've known me for long enough, you'll know I've got a few screws loose, and not just in the funny way.</p>
                    <p>Overall, though, I'm just the type of guy who has a hard time shutting the fuck up about anything. I have too many opinions to burden the masses with. If you're interested in those, allow me to redirect you to my blog.</p>

                    <summary>About the character</summary>
                    <p>The character you've seen across the website is me! Well, not quite. I (unfortunately) don't look like that offline. You can call them Amapola, but I also like to call them Cotton.</p>
                    <p>I created them because, back in middle school, I didn't like drawing myself as I looked like. Or at least not as much as drawing little creatures. So I made one for myself, like those artists online! Although, I must say, Cotton has gone through various iterations over time- they're far from my first fictional avatar. I can't tell you I know what species they are- they don't even want to tell <i>me,</i> little rascal!</p>
                    <p>You could say Cotton represents many things. They represent me, they represent what I wish I was, they represent a better version of myself, they represent a mask for me to use, they represent a more marketable version of myself, they represent a version of myself that I could never be because it would imply being a ficitonal character, including all the implications it carries. And, for the best, I am not fictional. They are. So there's that.</p>
                    <p>But among all that philosophical jargon, they're just a little guy.</p>

                    <summary>About the website</summary>
                    <p>The landscape of the internet gets more and more bleak with the passing years, months and weeks. I keep trying and trying different social medias and websites, but there's always one thing or another that makes it a fundamentally unenjoyable experience- wether it be the invasive advertising, the malfunctioning core features, or just a format that I cannot bring myself to enjoy. Additionally, we're all well aware of the toxicity looming over social networks at all times.</p>
                    <p>So, to try and combat all of this, I am now trying to make my own space, tailored to my tastes and what I want to share with the world.</p>
                    <p>I hope that this helps other people, too, make the leap towards making their own personal sites, so we can breathe fresh air into the worldwide web.</p>
